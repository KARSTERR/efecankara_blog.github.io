<p>Hello! My name is Efe Can Kara, and I am a 21-year-old student currently pursuing my studies at Sivas Cumhuriyet University. Born on September 27, 2003, I’ve always had a passion for technology, which has shaped both my academic and personal pursuits. As a student, I am constantly learning and exploring new fields of software development, aiming to build a career that blends both my academic knowledge and practical skills.</p>

<p>My primary areas of interest in software development are system programming with C++, IoT development, and data analysis. I enjoy working with microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32, where I can create innovative solutions and bring my ideas to life. From building small automation projects to analyzing data sets, I am always excited to tackle new challenges and deepen my understanding of these fascinating fields.</p>

<p class="mb-5">Outside of academics, I have a number of hobbies that help me stay creative and balanced. I'm an avid bass guitarist, and I enjoy playing music in my free time, which allows me to express myself in a different way. Additionally, I am a blogger and share my thoughts on technology, development, and life. When I’m not studying or blogging, you can find me immersed in my favorite video games. I believe that balancing both my passions and studies helps me maintain a healthy and productive lifestyle.</p>
